    <h1>about GOA</h1>
    <p>Global Online Academy (GOA) is a nonprofit organization which provides online classes, workshops, and other
        educational resources for students and teachers.[1] Accredited courses for middle and high school students are
        offered through GOA by a consortium of about 120 member schools, all independent.[2][3][4]

        Structure
        GOA courses are taught online by teachers at Academy member <schools class="" 5=""></schools>
        <br> These teachers create the coursework and schedule for each course, but the student experience is largely
        asynchronous.[6] Each course is 15 weeks long, with students spending (on average) 5-7 hours per week on work
        related to the course.[7]
        <br>
        Students at member schools have access to any course in the GOA catalog.[4]
        <br>
        Activity
        In 2020, GOA partnered with Western Governors University to offer public schools an online "Next Generation
        Teaching Series" focused on helping teachers effectively teach online during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8][9]
