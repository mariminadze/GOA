        Goal orientation, or achievement orientation, is an "individual disposition towards developing or validating
        one's ability in achievement settings".[1] In general, an individual can be said to be mastery or performance
        oriented, based on whether one's goal is to develop one's ability or to demonstrate one's ability,
        respectively.[2] A mastery orientation is also sometimes referred to as a learning orientation.

        Goal orientation refers to how an individual interprets and reacts to tasks, resulting in different patterns of
        cognition, affect and behavior.[3] Developed within a social-cognitive framework, the orientation goal theory
        proposes that students' motivation and achievement-related behaviors can be understood by considering the
        reasons or purposes they adopt while engaged in academic work.[4] The focus is on how students think about
        themselves, their tasks, and their performance.[5] Goal orientations have been shown to be associated with
        individuals' academic achievement, adjustment, and well-being.[6][7][8]

        Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and
        culture, performance appraisal, and choice.[9][10] It has also been used to predict sales performance, adaptive
        performance,[11] goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership.[9]
